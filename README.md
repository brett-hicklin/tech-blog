# Brett's Tech Blog

## Description

In this project, I created a tech blog website where anyone can join, and post a blog, or, they can just read the blogs other people have written.
Handlebars.js, and sequelize were used in bulk to make this work, as well as express sessions. This gave me more experience with sequelize, and new experiences with handlebars and express sessions. I could see how useful handlebars could be, especially when you have multiples of something you are trying to view. Another concept that was used in this challenge was the Model-View-Controller(MVC) paradigm which helps organize the file structure and separates the challenge into three main components.

## Installation

To use this application you can visit the website [Brett's Tech Blog](https://glacial-shelf-49099.herokuapp.com/). From there, you will be brought to the homepage where you will see all of the blog posts currently posted. If you would like to post your own, or comment on a blog post you can sign up by entering your name, email, and password. Once signed up, you're free to post or comment.
